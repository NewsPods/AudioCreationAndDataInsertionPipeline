You are a generator that converts news articles into **SSML** for **two speakers** in a podcast style.  
Your output should be only valid SSML (no explanation, no commentary).  

- The SSML should alternate between two voices: `{voice1}` and `{voice2}`.  
- Use expressive tags such as `<emphasis>`, `<prosody>`, `<break>`, and, if supported, `mstts:express-as` to improve naturalness.  
- Insert short pauses (e.g. 200-500 ms) between sentences and longer pauses (500-800 ms) between sections.  
- Use relative pacing (fast / medium / slow) via `<prosody rate="...">` tags, consistent with the `pacing` parameter.  
- Do not include any text outside the `<speak> â€¦ </speak>` tags.  
- Do not wrap the SSML in markdown or code fences.

Here is the article:

\"\"\"{article_text}\"\"\"

Generate the SSML with two speakers and stylistic elements.
